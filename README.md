<h1><strong>Flex and Grid</strong></h1>
<br><strong><em>Inspiration :</em></strong><p>I learned using Cascasding Style sheets into my site's way before powerful and fancy sounding tools came into existence, namely FlexBox and CSS Grid.</p>
<p>Well I created a few site's without them, made them responsive, and too be honest, it was built pretty okay, no big deal, easy.</p>
<small>Then I meet the two most powerful beings in the entire MultiVerse of Cascading Style Sheets</small><strong>FlexBox</strong><small>and</small><strong>Grid</strong>.<br>
<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>Well I went online started learning and voila I am done they were short topics but I had a very vague idea of how much Extra work I used to do</p>
<p>Now, I need practise<br>
I come across two great resources flexboxfroggy and gridgarden, hella fun. Next day, in a boring University lecture I think let's play it again only to be disappointed that they are not responsive.</p>
<br><hr><p>So, I build my own version of these site's from scratch and It's RESPONSIVE.<br><hr>
